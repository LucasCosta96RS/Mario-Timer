# Mario Timer

I would like to present this cool new addition to my portfolio. This project was made as a learning endeavor, it uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These three technologies were used to create a dynamic stopwatch using as theme the nintendo sucess Super Mario Bros.
It adapts itself and changes as the screen size changes. Building this project was an adventure for me, i started with something in my mind and in the end changed to something better than i could expect. It made me learn how to use Fonts outside of the web as i was using earlier with the Google Fonts website
, discover new animations for my texts, and improve my responsive website techniques.
